# DSB Repair Kinetics Calculator

The official pipelines for analysing designer nuclease-induced DSB repair kinetics data generated by [MEGA safety profiling](https://github.com/A-Chalk/MEGA). Novel programmable endonucleases are rapidly being produced to facilitate gene therapy development. Studying the kinetics of their DNA cleavage activity and subsequent cell repair can elucidate essential safety and efficacy information.

## Model Description

This pipeline employs the three-state model of DSB repair in which Cas9 cleavage, precise DNA repair, and mutatagenic repair are each constrained by fixed rate coeffecients $k_{dsb}(t)$, $k_{pr}$, and $k_{m}$ respectively.

$$Wildtype \xrightleftharpoons[k_{pr}]{k_{dsb}(t)}DSB\xrightarrow{k_m}Mutation$$

There are many possible reaction terminating products detected by MEGA, including indels, large deletions, and targeted gene integration, each with their own rate coeffecients $k_{in}$, $k_{ld}$, $k_{ti}$. 

This model is described by a set of ordinary differential equations:

* Wildtype rate | $\frac{dWildtype}{dt} = (k_{pr} * DSB)-(k_{dsb} * D(t) * WT)$<br/>
* DSB rate | $\frac{dDSB}{dt} = (k_{dsb} * D(t) * WT) - (k_{pr} + k_{in} + k_{ld}) * DSB$<br/>
* Precise repair rate | $\frac{dPR}{dt} = (k_{pr} * DSB)-(k_{dsb} * D(t) * PR)$<br/>
* Indel rate | $\frac{dIndel}{dt} = k_{in} * DSB$<br/>
* Large deletion rate | $\frac{dLD}{dt} = k_{ld} * DSB$<br/>
* Targeted integration rate | $\frac{dTI}{dt} = k_{ti} * DSB$<br/>
* Cas9 trafficking delay | $D(t) = 1 - 2^{-(\frac{t}{delay})}$

The pipeline uses these ODEs to estimate the $k$ values based on an your observed allele population frequencies.
